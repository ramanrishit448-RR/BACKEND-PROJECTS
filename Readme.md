# BACKEND PROJECT

This repository is a personal learning project focused on backend development. It contains a full-stack Node.js application (server-rendered) that demonstrates core backend skills: authentication, CRUD, file uploads, and server-side rendering.

I created this repository to learn backend concepts and to build a practical backend project.
